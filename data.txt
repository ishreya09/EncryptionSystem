Reaper is a series of three oil-on-canvas paintings by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh
of a man reaping a wheat field under a bright early-morning sun. This is the second
painting in the series, which Van Gogh appears to have completed in a single day in
France, while taking breaks to write a letter on 5 September 1889. 
In a later part of the letter, he announced: "Phew the reaper is finished, I think it 
will be one that you'll place in your home". Van Gogh initially preferred this version over 
the earlier study, describing it as "an image of death as the great Book of Nature speaks to 
us about it but what I sought is the 'almost smiling'. It's all yellow except for a line of 
violet hills a pale, blond yellow. I myself find that funny, that I saw it like that through 
the iron bars of a cell." The painting is now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.
